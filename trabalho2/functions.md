# socketSend

This is a function in the C programming language that sends a string over a network connection. The function takes two arguments: a network_t structure that contains information about the network connection, and a string buffer buf that contains the data to be sent.

The function first retrieves the socket descriptor from the network_t structure, and then uses the write() function to send the contents of the string buffer buf to the server. It also appends a two-byte end terminator to the data, which is a special sequence of bytes used to indicate the end of a message.

If the write() function returns a non-positive value, indicating an error, the function prints an error message using the perror() function and then exits the program with an error code. Otherwise, the function returns without doing anything else.

Overall, this function is used to send a string over a network connection using the socket descriptor stored in the network_t structure.

# socketReadCommand

This is a function in the C programming language that reads a command from a network connection. The function takes three arguments: a network_t structure that contains information about the network connection, a string buffer resp where the command will be stored, and the size of the string buffer, given by size.

The function first uses the read() function to read up to size - 1 bytes of data from the network connection into the string buffer resp. If read() returns a positive value, indicating that some data was read, the function checks if the number of bytes read is equal to size. If so, it prints an error message using the fputs() function and exits the program with an error code. Otherwise, it appends a null terminator to the end of the string in the buffer resp.

If read() returns a non-positive value, indicating an error, the function prints an error message using the perror() function and then exits the program with an error code.

Overall, this function is used to read a command from a network connection using the socket descriptor stored in the network_t structure, and store the command in the string buffer resp.

# readSockFileToStdout

This is a function in the C programming language that reads data from a network connection and writes it to standard output. The function takes a single argument: a network_t structure that contains information about the network connection.

The function first declares a string buffer buf of size 100 and initializes it to all zeros. It then enters a loop that repeatedly reads up to 100 bytes of data from the network connection into the string buffer buf using the read() function. If read() returns a positive value, indicating that some data was read, the function uses the fputs() function to write the contents of the string buffer buf to standard output.

The loop continues until read() returns a non-positive value, indicating that no more data is available to be read. At that point, the function exits the loop and returns.

Overall, this function is used to read data from a network connection using the socket descriptor stored in the network_t structure, and write the data to standard output.

# readSockFileToFile

This is a function in the C programming language that reads data from a network connection and writes it to a file. The function takes two arguments: a network_t structure that contains information about the network connection, and a file pointer file that points to the file where the data will be written.

The function first declares a string buffer buf of size READ_BUFFER and enters a loop that repeatedly reads up to READ_BUFFER bytes of data from the network connection into the string buffer buf using the read() function. If read() returns a positive value, indicating that some data was read, the function uses the fwrite() function to write the contents of the string buffer buf to the file pointed to by file.

If fwrite() returns a non-positive value, indicating an error, the function prints an error message using the perror() function and then exits the program with an error code. Otherwise, the loop continues until read() returns a non-positive value, indicating that no more data is available to be read. At that point, the function exits the loop and returns.

Overall, this function is used to read data from a network connection using the socket descriptor stored in the network_t structure, and write the data to the file pointed to by the file pointer.

# setLogin

This is a function in the C programming language that logs in to an FTP server using a user name and password. The function takes a single argument: an ftp_t structure that contains information about the FTP connection, including the user name and password.

The function first constructs two strings, user_c and pass_c, by concatenating the user name and password stored in the ftp_t structure with the strings "USER " and "PASS ", respectively. It then uses the socketSend() function to send the user_c string to the FTP server, and uses the socketReadCommand() function to read the server's response.

Next, the function uses the ftpErrorResponse() function to check if the server's response indicates an error, and if so, it prints an error message and exits the program with an error code. If the response is successful, the function sends the pass_c string to the FTP server and uses the socketReadCommand() function to read the server's response again.

Once again, the function uses the ftpErrorResponse() function to check if the server's response indicates an error, and if so, it prints an error message and exits the program with an error code. If the response is successful, the function returns without doing anything else.

Overall, this function is used to log in to an FTP server using the user name and password stored in the ftp_t structure, and check for errors in the server's responses.

# ftpErrorResponse

This is a function in the C programming language that checks if a string starts with a specific prefix. The function takes four arguments: a string response to be checked, a string startswith that specifies the prefix to check for, an integer n that indicates the number of characters to compare, and a string msg that contains an error message to be printed if the check fails.

The function first uses the strncmp() function to compare the first n characters of the response string with the startswith string. If the two strings are not equal, the function uses the fputs() function to print the error message msg to standard error, and then exits the program with an error code. Otherwise, the function returns without doing anything else.

Overall, this function is used to check if the response string starts with the startswith string, and if not, it prints an error message and exits the program with an error code.

# downloadFile

This code is a function that downloads a file from an FTP server. The function is passed a pointer to an ftp_t struct, which contains information needed to connect to the FTP server, such as the host name, port number, username, and password.

The function first opens the file that the data will be downloaded to, using the fopen function with the "wb" mode, which indicates that the file should be opened for writing in binary mode.

Next, the function sends a "PASV" command to the FTP server to enter passive mode, which allows the server to open a data connection for transferring the file. The server's response to this command is read into the buf buffer, and an error message is printed if the response indicates that there was a problem entering passive mode.

The handlePASVresp function is then called to process the server's response to the "PASV" command and create a new network_t struct that can be used to transfer the file. This struct is used to send the "RETR" command to the FTP server to request the file, followed by the path to the file on the server.

Once the file transfer has been initiated, the function reads the data from the server using the readSockFileToFile function and writes it to the local file. The function then reads the FTP server's response to the file transfer and prints an error message if the response indicates that there was a problem transferring the file. Finally, the function closes the local file and the data connection to the FTP server, and frees the memory associated with the network_t struct.

# handlePASVresp

This code is a function that processes the FTP server's response to a "PASV" command and returns a new network_t struct that can be used to transfer the file.

The function is passed a pointer to an existing network_t struct, net, which contains information about the connection to the FTP server, and a buffer, buf, which holds the server's response to the "PASV" command.

The function first creates a new network_t struct, netpasv, using the newNet function, which allocates memory for the struct and initializes its fields. The addr field of the new network_t struct is then set to the value of the addr field of the existing network_t struct, net, so that the new struct will use the same host address and port number as the original connection.

Next, the parsePort function is called to extract the port number from the server's response and store it in the port field of the new network_t struct. The getSocketfd function is then called to create a new socket for the data connection and store the socket descriptor in the sockfd field of the struct.

Finally, the function returns a pointer to the new network_t struct, which can be used to transfer the file.
